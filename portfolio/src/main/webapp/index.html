      <p style="border:2px solid #9FF0D1;width:450px">I am a first generation college student studying Computer Science at Michigan State University! 
          I plan on having a cognate in Math as well as a minor in Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering which focuses on data science techniques - numbers and graphs are cool. </p>

      <p style="border:2px solid #9FF0D1;width:450px"> My journey to majoring in Computer Science was not a straight path; 
          I originally planned to major in Mechanical Engineering, then after participating in Google's CSSI I fell in love with Computer Science and made the switch, 
          then it was Physics after discovering fascinating research opportunities using computing, and then back to Computer Science once I realized it was my true passion after being a TA for a Computer Science summer program.</p>
      <p style="border:2px solid #9FF0D1;width:450px"> My two favorite on campus jobs I have had so far have been being a TA and a Research Assistant.
          I was a TA for a Computer Science program through MSU's Engineering Science Success Academy! The Computer Science portion of the program focused 
          on preparing incoming freshmen for their first intro CS course at MSU by teaching them the basics of Python. My next favorite job was my Research Assistant position at the 
          National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab on MSU's campus; there I would perform data analytics on tin isotope collisions using C++ for a Nuclear Physicist. </p>
